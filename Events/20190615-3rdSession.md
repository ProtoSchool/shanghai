## Summary
This is a very successful technical meetup, lasting about 3.5 hours in the nice afternoon. We have double attendees comparing to
the previous session, about 30 engineers joined this event. The 3 topics are very attractive too for developers and researchers. 
Xin Jiang, as the cryptographic engineer from PPIO, had a wonderful presentation about the algorithms of how ECC is working; Steven, 
the CTO from IPFS Force, analyzed consensus common knowledge and how Filecoin adopts existing researchs to achieve its target via 
a simple way. Yongjun Qian, the early developer of blockchain, traveled from Xi'an, specailly for this event, presented how to 
develop IPFS-based web application.

 After the end of this session, there were lots of discussion and people did not want to leave. Let's meet next month.
